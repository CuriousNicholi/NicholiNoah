# About Me
We live in a beautifully emerging new era. Humans and machines working together, transcending greatness through accessible communication. From video camera to virtual reality, I'm expanding upon an award-winning creative career that stretches across education, advertising, documentary, and design with a focus on accessibility and cultural awareness. Seeking to collaborate on a team of dedicated future-thinkers determined to forge new tools out of wild ideas and teach our community we can all win this together.

&nbsp; Hi, I'm Nicholi.
<br>
<br>
A curious storyteller with over 15 years of creative video production experience, 5 years of project management & process development, 3 years leading junior creative teams, and a knack for finding patterns and solving problems. I believe in cultivating a culture of trust through awareness, empowerment, and open communication. My philosophy is that positive accountability and honest expectations lead to strong relationships and even stronger creative solutions.
