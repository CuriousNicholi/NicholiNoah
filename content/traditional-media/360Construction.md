**CHALLENGE:** Construction sites are too dangerous for educators to teach Construction Management courses on-location. Create a virtual experience providing students a safe alternative for identifying and documenting OSHA violations on an active construction site. Must be accessible to all students using available technology both in classroom and at home.

**BACKGROUND:** The first industry job newly graduated Construction Management majors apply for is documenting safety violations. This consists of identifying issues, taking photographs, then writing a report with details of the violation. My goal was to replicate this process as accurately as possible, preparing each student with truly virtual on-the-job training.

**OPPORTUNITY:** The most widely discussed opponent of 360VR video is, “You can’t make viewers look where you want them to look.” While this is certainly difficult for traditional filmmakers, it is also provides a perfect opportunity to stimulate viewers who are supposed to seek out hidden elements on screen. This was the perfect project to implement this as a creative solution to a unique challenge.
