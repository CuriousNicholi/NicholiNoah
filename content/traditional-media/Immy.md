**CHALLENGE:** Create a teaser video showcasing a prototype virtual reality headset. The prototype is not accessible, and no demo content exists. Must use 100% stock (or newly shot) footage and music, with a 4-day turnaround.

**OPPORTUNITY:** This is the project that first introduced me to virtual reality in 2015, before I’d even worn a headset… a very rewarding opportunity in itself. Additionally, this gave an exciting chance to paint a picture of what I believed the future of VR tech could look like. Using progressively faster cuts and increasingly dramatic sound effects to build suspense, I maximized the limited stock footage to capture the viewer’s emotional attention. Then overlaid motion graphics to capture their logical attention and communicate industrial applications for this emerging tech to potential investors who had yet to imagine what this future could look like.
Over five years later, this video admittedly does look outdated. However, I’m proud that these basic concepts jump started and inspired my passion for virtual and extended reality.
