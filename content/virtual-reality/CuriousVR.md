What do you do when the whole world is in a pandemic and you're stuck by yourself in your room for several months?
Turn your room into a playground and practice new skills while exploring your personal brand.
That was the core inspiration for CuriousVR Show. It was also a great opportunity to calibrate my prototype mixed reality camera and grow the CuriousVR Youtube channel all at the same time.


All at the same time, I had the opportunity to: test my prototype stereo camera in a real project setting, 
"Since I can't meet friends in real life, I'll make virtual friends in VR and invite them to my real life room. It's a great opportunity to test my prototype stereo camera in a real project setting."

It's a great opportunity to test my prototype stereo camera in a real project setting, and further explore my own brand identity, and spend way more time on this project that I had originally planned but it was totally worth it. But what do I do with it?

Make a Youtube channel of course.

This also serves a great opportunity to test out my stereo camera system. 

Quite honestly, this idea has been floating in my head for a couple years now. Make a weekly talk/news show dedicated to virtual reality. In virtual reality, for virtual reality.

After creating my persona, my persona began shaping me. 

CuriousVR is an explorer. One of the first from our world to fly off into the unknown.

Chronon, the time particle. She's that tiny pink orb 


Years ago, after having just been introduced to virtual realtiy, I had a dream that I was traveling through time, inside a tiny pink orb. After that, my imagination just wouldn't stop thinking about it.  

I have a uniquely specific and equally as cool mission: document the rise of socialVR in it's natural habitat, recording stereoscopic video to portray this growing culture as authentically as possible for viewers five years from now.

What do you do when the whole world locks down and you're stuck all by yourself in your room for several months?
Turn your room into a playground and develop new skills at the same time.
That was the core inspiration for CuriousVR Show. Since I can't meet friends in real life, I'll make virtual friends in VR and invite them to my real life room. 

After months of thinking, hacking, and tinkering, I finally had my stereoscopic mixed reality video capture system developed enough to be reliable. About two minutes later I realized, even the coolest new special effect is only cool if it has a story. 

CuriousVR℠ Show is the first, only, and certainly strangest stereoscopic mixed reality show in the entire Metaverse.

I have a wild imagination. But I also make interesting discoveries based on theories based in discovery.


I am absolutely 100% brick wall determined to create my own stereoscopic camera system that mixes virtual and reality together seemlessly in real time. 
We live in an era when algorithms are trained to constantly give us more of the exact same thing we were just paying attention to. I wanted to make something different. The kind of different you'll never find anywhere else. A style algorithms have yet to understand... or even see for that matter.

If you can't already tell, I am passionate about VR. Specifically social VR. It is a collaborative working space where expression is currency and patience is norm. We build our imaginations out of shapes and code.

We trade with others
