CuriousVR℠ Show is the first, only, and certainly strangest stereoscopic mixed reality show in the entire Metaverse.

I have a wild imagination. But I also make interesting discoveries based on theories based in discovery.


I am absolutely 100% brick wall determined to create my own stereoscopic camera system that mixes virtual and reality together seemlessly in real time. 
We live in an era when algorithms are trained to constantly give us more of the exact same thing we were just paying attention to. I wanted to make something different. The kind of different you'll never find anywhere else. A style algorithms have yet to understand... or even see for that matter.

If you can't already tell, I am passionate about VR. Specifically social VR. It is a collaborative working space where expression is currency and patience is norm. We build our imaginations out of shapes and code.

We trade with others
